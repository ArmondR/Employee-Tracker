# Employee-Tracker

## Description

This application is an employee tracker. With the use of node.js and code terminal, the user is given prompts that allow them to interact with the database.

##  Future Development

In future development of this application I would like to finish the functionality of the overall application and also add aditional functionality. 
##  Usage 

The application will need to be accessed through the use of node.js.

## Collaborators

Instructional staff TA Bobby Hoffman assisted with some code logic.

## Installation

You must download the application code from the repository and clone it to your local machine. After the code has been cloned to your machine, you can then type 'npm install' in the directory of that repository to have access to the dependencies for this application to work. To have access to database you must enter your SQL credentials into the template located in the '.env' file in the root directory.
